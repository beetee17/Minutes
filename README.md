# Minutes: AI Voice Notes

This is a GitHub repository that was created for users of my iOS task manager, [Minutes](https://testflight.apple.com/join/5z25NHwR), to report bugs and submit feature requests.

### Before Submitting

**Before making your submission**, please take a look under [issues](https://github.com/beetee17/Minutes/issues) to see if your issue/request has been made by another user! If that is the case, do upvote it and/or add comments to the existing thread instead of creating a new one.

Submit a [bug report with this link](https://github.com/beetee17/Minutes/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D), or make a [feature request with this link](https://github.com/beetee17/Minutes/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D).
